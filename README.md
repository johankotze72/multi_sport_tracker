# Multi-sport tracing app 
A open source multi-sport tracing app uses IMU-based sensors to trace the movement of any board, providing the user with live feedback on inportant performance parameters. It can be uses by coaches or boardes.
## HOW
The app is open source and free and connces to commercial off-the-shelf motion sport tracking sensors (such as movesense).
This solves a couple of issues most such sensor had in the past.
- No propriotory sensor development costs
- Increased user numbers, due to the use for multiple board sports
- No business case that needs to make a short term ROI
- Programmer passionate about difference board sports can develop different versions of the app, or modes within the app.
The app should be able to measure:
- Board speed
- Trick type
- Jump height
- Air time
- Jump distance
- Foot timing and more...

## SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
- Code needs to be as modular as possible, so that it can be shared between the differnt sports
- Coded mostly in Flutter to enable deplayment on various operating systems.
- Use AI to continuously learn and get better
- Give useful feedback

## BUSINESS MODEL
Users buy sensors directly from suppliers. Find solutions enabling the app to always stay free, while generating enough funds to support continous improvement.
- Sport brands sponsor certain spots
- Sell clips to fix the sensor to the boards.
- Show classic adds
- Earn money via the coaching platform

## SENSORS
We hope to support as many sensors as possible and as starting with those providing easy APIs and SDKs.

### Movesense
Movesense is an established sports sensor with a well-documented API and integrations.
